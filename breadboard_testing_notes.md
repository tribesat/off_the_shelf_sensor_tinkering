## Light and Temp sensesing

These sensors are connected to an arudino uno with a logic shifter

TSL2561 I2C address (adr floating): 0x39

* Works at this address alone
* does not work when VEML 6070 and TMP102 also in circuit

TMP102 I2C address (adr low): 0x48

* Everything with this works as expected

VEML 6070 (no adr change possible): 0x39 AND 0x38

* You need two I2C address to read from this, this is weird but it's the way it is
* Works with TMP102 and TSL2561 in circuit
* I2C conflict with the TSL, this one seems to win

TSL2561 I2C (adr low): 0x29

* I went low to get past the I2C conflict 
* High would change it to 0x49, I didn't do this because I'm scared of confilicts with the TMP102
* Now works with full circuit

## MPU9250

This sensor has been giving me problems, right now it is connected to a 8Mhz, 3.3V arduino pro mini. I did this to get rid of the logic shifter as a variable, and because the code I'm trying to use was developed on this system

I2C scanner shows 0x0C and 0x68

* We expect two I2C address from the baord because the accelerometer/gyro and magnetometer are independent (sorta)

We are failing to comunicate with the board over SPI

Switch back to I2C and pull CS high: did not work

# 18Nov2017

Going to try out the LSM9DS1 board

Wire into I2C

Use [Sparkfun lSM9DS1 Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_LSM9DS1_Arduino_Library) basic I2C sketch

Output:

```

Looks real good

This chip has a 3.5x3mm 24pin package, this is slightly larger than the MPU-9250 3x3mm 24pin

I don't know if this is realy large enought to make a diffrence for assembly but is worth a look
